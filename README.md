# CFS Quota Bug Test

At work, I noticed some throttling in some of our key data services we run in Kubernetes. Although I think the root cause was having too low of a cpu request set on those, I came to learn that there was a kernel level issue making this worse.

I first learned about it here: [CFS quotas can lead to unnecessary throttling](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577)

I believe this was eventually patched in later kernel versions, but may still affect older systems.

I found a simple test case to check for this, thanks to Ivan Babrou.

This repo contains a Dockerized version of this very helpful post: [Overly aggressive CFS](https://gist.github.com/bobrik/2030ff040fad360327a5fab7a09c4ff1)

The high level summary here is, we run a test case which has a well defined work period of 5ms and _should not_ experience throttling.

When no cpu quotas are used, it runs as expected and the main work loop completes consistently in about 5ms.

When quotas are used, I've random it runs as expected and the main work loop completes consistently in about 5ms.

## Running with Docker

```sh
docker run --rm -it seanshahkarami/cfs-quota-bug-test -iterations 100 -sleep 100ms
docker run --rm -it seanshahkarami/cfs-quota-bug-test -iterations 100 -sleep 1000ms
docker run --rm -it --cpu-quota 20000 --cpu-period 100000 seanshahkarami/cfs-quota-bug-test -iterations 100 -sleep 100ms
docker run --rm -it --cpu-quota 20000 --cpu-period 100000 seanshahkarami/cfs-quota-bug-test -iterations 100 -sleep 1000ms
docker run --rm -it --cpu-quota 20000 --cpu-period 100000 seanshahkarami/cfs-quota-bug-test -iterations 10 -sleep 5000ms
```

## Running with Kubernetes

```sh
# test without quotas
kubectl apply -f job-without-quota.yaml

# test with quotas
kubectl apply -f job-with-quota.yaml
```
